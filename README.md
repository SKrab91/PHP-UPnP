PHP class for communicating with UPnP devices by multicasting and
unicasting. Also supports SOAP requests.

The reason I am developing this is mainly for creating a Web GUI for
controlling my Smart TV as a MediaRenderer over the local network.

I cannot guarantee that this class will work properly.
It is still in the development phase.

I you have any questions about UPnP, please refer to the UPnP
documentations and forums at http://www.upnp.org .
